# City Happiness Index Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a **Composite Happiness Index** for cities, combining various factors such as **Happiness Score**, **Air Quality**, **Green Space**, **Cost of Living**, **Healthcare**, **Traffic Density**, and **Noise Levels** to rank cities based on overall happiness and quality of life.

### The goal of the project is to:
- Create a **Composite Happiness Index** by combining multiple factors.
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the dataset.
- Analyze the relationships between different factors and their impact on happiness.
- Visualize the results and provide insights on the top cities based on the happiness index.
- Compare the **Composite Happiness Index** with the **original Happiness Score** from the dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **City Happiness Index 2024**, which includes data on various factors like:
- **City**: The name of the city.
- **Month**: The month the data was recorded.
- **Year**: The year the data was recorded.
- **Decibel Level**: The noise pollution level in decibels.
- **Traffic Density**: The level of traffic congestion in the city (Low, Medium, High).
- **Green Space Area**: The amount of green space available in the city.
- **Air Quality Index**: The quality of air in the city.
- **Happiness Score**: A measure of the happiness of residents.
- **Cost of Living Index**: The relative cost of living in the city.
- **Healthcare Index**: The quality of healthcare in the city.

The dataset is processed and analyzed using **Python**, with libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**.
