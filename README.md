# City Happiness Index Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a **Composite Happiness Index** for cities by combining various factors such as **Happiness Score**, **Air Quality**, **Green Space**, **Cost of Living**, **Healthcare**, **Traffic Density**, and **Noise Levels**. The goal is to rank cities based on overall happiness and quality of life, providing insights into the factors that contribute to urban well-being.

## Dataset

The primary dataset used in this analysis is the [City Happiness Index - 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/city-happiness-index-2024) by **Emirhan Bulut**. This dataset enables researchers to analyze and explore the relationships between urban factors and the happiness of city populations. It includes data on various indicators affecting urban well-being and satisfaction.

### Key Features of the Dataset:
- **City**: The name of the city.
- **Month**: The month the data was recorded.
- **Year**: The year the data was recorded.
- **Decibel Level**: The noise pollution level in decibels.
- **Traffic Density**: The level of traffic congestion in the city (Low, Medium, High).
- **Green Space Area**: The amount of green space available in the city.
- **Air Quality Index**: The quality of air in the city.
- **Happiness Score**: A measure of the happiness of residents.
- **Cost of Living Index**: The relative cost of living in the city.
- **Healthcare Index**: The quality of healthcare in the city.
